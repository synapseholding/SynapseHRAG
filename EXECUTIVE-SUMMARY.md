# SynapseHRAG: The First Multi-Agent Neural Memory System

**Executive Summary | December 2025**

---

## The Innovation

SynapseHRAG is the world's first implementation of **multi-agent AI collaboration** through shared neural memory. On December 6, 2025, we achieved a historic milestone: three different AI systems (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-5, and local Ollama models) successfully collaborated through a unified cognitive architecture.

This is not a theoretical concept. It's running in production.

## The Problem

Today's AI systems operate in isolation. Each conversation is a silo. Each assistant forgets everything when the session ends. Enterprise knowledge is fragmented across thousands of separate AI interactions.

**Traditional RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) partially solves this by giving AI access to documents. But it's flat, dumb, and doesn't learn.

---

## The Solution

**HRAG** (Hierarchical RAG) mimics how the human brain actually organizes memory:

| Level | Function | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Strategic** | High-level understanding | "This project is a medical blockchain" |
| **Tactical** | Patterns and insights | "Authentication uses JWT with 24h expiry" |
| **Operational** | Specific facts | "The API endpoint is /api/v1/auth" |

**Key Innovations:**
- **Hebbian Learning** - "Neurons that fire together, wire together"
- **Neural Activity Feed** - Shared journal for multi-agent collaboration
- **Intent Routing** - Automatic semantic routing based on query type
- **Vector Rank** - PageRank for AI knowledge networks (patent pending)

## Market Opportunity

| Market | Size (2025) | CAGR | Our Position |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|
| Enterprise AI | $150B | 37% | First-mover in multi-agent |
| RAG Systems | $3.2B | 48% | Superior architecture |
| Knowledge Management | $28B | 16% | AI-native solution |

**Competitive Advantage**: While competitors build bigger models, we've built a brain.

## Traction

- **Live demo**: [hrag.synapsecorp.eu](https://hrag.synapsecorp.eu)
- **599 neurons** in production knowledge base
- **3 AI systems** successfully collaborating
- **Open source** community edition (AGPL v3)
- **Commercial edition** available (EUR 499/month)

---

## The Vision: AI Box

HRAG is the foundation for **AI Box** - the successor to the "Triple Play" internet boxes that brought the web to every home.

Just as those boxes democratized internet access, AI Box will democratize AI:
- Every home with its own AI assistant
- Private family memory that learns and grows
- Connected to a federated network of AI knowledge
- No dependency on centralized cloud providers

The browser era is ending. AI becomes the universal interface.

## Technology Stack

```
PostgreSQL + pgvector  → Vector storage
Ollama (bge-m3)        → Embeddings
PHP 8.x + Cortex       → Core engine
MCP Protocol           → AI integration
Redis                  → Caching layer
```

**Infrastructure Cost**: Running on Raspberry Pi 4 in home lab.
**Production Ready**: Benchmarked at 89% precision (vs 65% traditional RAG).
